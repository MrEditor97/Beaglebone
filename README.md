# Beaglebone

When you have been looking for ages on the internet on how to be able to do something with the Beaglebone, and then you come across this website...then you realise that before, it was such a waist of time. Why didn't you just come here in the first place?

Have you been struggling to find anything on the internet to do with Kernel 3.14?

Maybe you want to be able to get straight to the point with your Beaglebone?
Do you want a pre-compiled image?
This is the source for everything that you want, to be able to use your Beaglebone to its full potential.

This is the new home for information to do with your Beaglebone. If you need some help on how to do something, don't worry, just ask. Whether its from setting up GPIO's for Onewire or PWM to how to get you started, we will always be ready to help.

I will be slowly adding to this repository at points as I find out new things about the Beaglebone myself.
