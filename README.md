# Beaglebone

I have been spending time looking into the new Beaglebone Kernel, and am now startin to update the API's that I have previously produced. I am also attempting to make them easier to use for general users.

This is the home of my code for the projects that I am involved in.

I am currently on with using different components connected to the Beaglebone to try and find out what works well and what doesn't work quite as well as first thought it might. I will be slowly adding to this repository at points as I find out new things about the Beaglebone myself.
